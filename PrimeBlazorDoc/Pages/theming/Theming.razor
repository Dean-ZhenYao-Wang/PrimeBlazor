        <p>
            <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/designer/primevue">Designer API</a> is the ultimate tool to create your own PrimeVue experience powered by a SASS based theme engine
            with 500+ variables and a demo application. In addition, PrimeVue only ships the generated CSS of <b>Nova</b>, <b>Luna</b> and <b>Rhea</b> themes whereas Designer provides
            full access to the whole SASS structure and the variables of these pre-built themes.
        </p>

        <p>Whether you have your own style guide or just need a custom theme, Designer API is the right tool to design and bring them to existence.</p>
